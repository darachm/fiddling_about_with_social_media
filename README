This is for keeping track of the CSHL Yeast Course participants
and coordinating efforts to keep these folks (1) in contact, (2)
tracked, and (3) engaged with social media platforms.

Data contains the big course list from Patricia, as well as 
raw inventory lists, versions of the database, etc.
I'm tracking this with git because I'm lazy and it's small plain 
text files.
